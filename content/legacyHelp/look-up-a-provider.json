            "answer": "You can optionally enter multiple cities, counties, MSAs, state abbreviations, or zip codes (3-digit or 5-digit). The system does not permit searching on other partial zip codes or free form text.\n\n"

            "question": "How do multiple geographies work?",
            "answer": "The geography search uses 'or' logic, so if you enter 'Johnson County, KS' and 'Topeka, KS MSA' you will see providers that reside in either geography.\n\n"

            "question": "Why am I getting back some results that don't match the name I entered?",

            "question": "Why am I getting some results with addresses that don't match the geography I entered?",

            "question": "Why am I getting results where none of the addresses match the geography I entered?",
            "answer": "The exact boundaries of cities aren't always well known by users, so city-based searches include providers in adjacent municipalities that share zip codes.\n\n"
