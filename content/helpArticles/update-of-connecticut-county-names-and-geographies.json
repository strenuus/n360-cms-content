  "body": "2024: October 16th\n\nThe US Census Bureau recently updated the county geographies in Connecticut to reflect the names and geographic scope of current County-equivalent Planning regions. This change will be visible in Network360 over the next several weeks as projects are refreshed.\n\nPreviously, there were 11 counties in Connecticut in Network360. After this change is published, there will be 9.\n\n**Connecticut Counties in Network360** \n\n*  Capitol County, CT \n* Greater Bridgeport County, CT \n* Lower Ct River Vly County, CT \n* Naugatuck Vly County, CT \n* Northeastern Ct County, CT \n* NW Hills County, CT \n* South Central Ct County, CT \n* Southeastern Ct County, CT \n* Western Ct County, CT \n\nGoing forward, the regions will be used as counties in all geography selection criteria in Network360. Since the new regions are slightly different from the old counties, we recommend using MSA groupings as an alternative. For example, to analyze network data around Hartford, use the Hartford-East Hartford – Middletown, CT MSA. \n\n \n\nConsider running ZIP code level reports for Connecticut to make sure that you understand how these changes affect your internal reporting. For more details about the Connecticut changes, here’s a summary from the US Census Bureau: [2022 Geography Changes (census.gov)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/table-and-geography-changes/2022/geography-changes.html).
