  "body": "(Effective 09/01/2021)\n\nNetwork360 has a **12-month** data retention policy for all client user-generated xports, Adequacy and Accessibility analyses, and population files.  \n\nTo improve the user experience, Network360 will remove:  \n\n* All exports that were created over 12 months ago. \n* All analyses that were last updated over 12 months ago. \n* Any unused population file created over 12 months ago.  \n\nIf you want to retain an older analysis, please update it by changing the criteria and running the analysis again. \n\nTo retain a population file, please use the file in any analysis.\n\n**Policy Benefits** \n\n* Reducing the number of historical user generated reports stored within Network360 can:  \n* Help improve system performance. \n* Allow for faster report generation response time and delivery. \n* Keep costs in line by reducing the amount of storage required to run Network360.  \n\n**Policy Notification** \n\nWhen a user tries to download a report that has been deleted for exceeding the retention policy, a notification will appear."
