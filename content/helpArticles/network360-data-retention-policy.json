  "shortDescription": "An explanation of Network360's data retention policy and when/how impacted users are notified.",
  "body": "(Effective 09/01/2021)\n\n\n\nNetwork360 has a **one-year** data retention policy for all client user-generated CSV and PDF exports. All export files with creation dates exceeding one year will be deleted from the system by an automated process that runs nightly.\n\n**Policy Benefits**\n\nReducing the number of historical user generated reports stored within Network360 can: \n\n* Help improve system performance.\n* Allow for faster report generation response time and delivery.\n* Keep costs in line by reducing the amount of storage required to run Network360. \n\n**Policy Notification**\n\nWhen a user tries to download a report that has been deleted for exceeding the data retention policy, a banner message will display the following:\n\nThe CSV or PDF report you tried to download from the Activity Stream can no longer be accessed because it's over one year old. Due to Network360's data retention policy, any user generated export will be automatically deleted when it's over one year old. We recommend you rerun your export to take advantage of the latest project data updates."
