  "body": "## Overview\n\n**Tags** are user-assigned notations that can be applied to providers or provider locations. There are multiple places in the system where tags can be assigned, including Detail Results, Provider Profile pages, Recruitment List, and Accessibility. The Tagging feature in Network360 allows users to tag providers or providers at specific locations with keywords so that they can be easily found again when filtering or searching.\n\nTags are categorized into four groups: System Generated, Global, Enterprise, and User.\n\n## Creating Tags\n\nTo view all available tags and create new User tags, navigate to **Settings > Project Settings > Tags** tab. You can create your own tags on the Tags tab. \n\n![](/cms/cms-assets/media/creating-tag.png)\n\n![](/cms/cms-assets/media/creating-tag1.png)\n\n## Adding Tags\n\n<br>\n1.

Enter the tag name to be added as a User Tag. Click the **Add Tag** button.\n\n  ![](/cms/cms-assets/media/creating-tag3.png)\n\n3. A success or unsuccessful message will be displayed.

Use the left side bar navigation panel to select either Recruitment & Research or Sales Tools. Using Create a List, you can develop a summary of a list of providers that meet your selected criteria.  \n\nTo use tags to search in this module, first enter your desired search criteria. Then, select tags that the provider would be **Tagged with** or **Not tagged with**. The list of tags within the criteria section consists of only tags assigned within the project.\n\nThe **Tagged with** and **Not tagged with** fields both work in the same manner.\n\n![](/cms/cms-assets/media/tags_create-a-list.png)\n<br>\n**Note:**\n<br> \nOn the **Create a List** Provider List page, you can add tags to provider or provider locations. However, you cannot add tags to provider or provider locations within the search criteria page.\n\nIf you want to query the provider data based on previously assigned tags, select one or more from the list. If no tags are present in the list, that means no providers have been tagged.\n\nIf you want to ensure that each provider returned in the search has matched on all tags that you have selected, select the **must have all tags** check box. \n\n## Tagging Providers\n\n<br>\nYou can apply tags to a provider when you are on a Provider Profile, regardless of the path you took to get there.\n\n1.

Administrative users can create, edit or delete an Enterprise tag from the system.\n\n**Blue:** Global tags are system-wide tags available to every client (i.e., Recruiting: Target, Inactive: Retired). Global tags can be seen and used by all users in the project. Global tags cannot be edited or deleted from the system by any user.\n\n**Purple:** System Generated Automatic tags are automatically applied when data is imported into the system (i.e., Medicare PAR). System Generated tags can be seen by all users in the project but cannot be applied to or removed from a provider or provider location. System Generated tags cannot be edited or deleted from the system by any user.\n\n## Bulk Tags\n\nBulk tags are used to save time and allow you to assign tags to more than one provider or provider location at the same time.\n\nBulk Tags are assigned on:\n\nThe **Provider List** displayed in the **Detail results** page of **Competitive Dashboard, Compare Networks, Create a List** and **Model Networks** modules \n\nand\n\n **Recruitment** list displayed in **Detail Results** page of the **Recruitment** module. \n\nFor example, **Inactive: Deceased** or **Recruiting: Credentialing**.\n\nProcedure to add one or more tags:\n\n1.
