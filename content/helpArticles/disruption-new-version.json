  "body": "# Overview\n\nDisruption will assist payers in assessing the competitiveness of their network to another network using utilization data provided by an employer looking to switch health plans. \n\n## Accessing Disruption\n\nThe Disruption module requires activation by Zelis, on the client, project and user levels. Once this has been completed, Disruption is accessible under Sales Tools in the left column navigation. Depending on your setup, you may see Disruption (new version), Disruption (old version) or both. \n\n## Running a Disruption Analysis\n\nTo perform a Disruption analysis, you will need the following: \n\n* Utilization File  \\\n  Uploaded by clients into the Disruption module; it contains data on claims aggregated at the provider, address, and TIN levels. \n* Mapping of the utilization file headers to the Zelis standard column names  \\\n  Clients will also map the columns that are in the Utilization File to the standard columns of data available in Network360   \n* Matching configuration  \\\n  This is created within the Disruption module of Network360. A Matching Configuration allows you to define the parameters checked during the analysis portion of this process. \n\n### Importing a Utilization File\n\nTo import a Utilization file: \n\n1. Navigate to Disruption, then click on Utilization Files \n2. Click on + Import File  \n3. Navigate to the file location to drag and drop the file onto the Upload section OR Click the Upload section to select the file, then click the Open button.  \n\n**Note:** The maximum file size is 100 mb; the recommended format is .csv\n\n![](/cms/cms-assets/media/importingutilizationfile.png)\n\n\n\nBelow the Upload section, are fields to enter the following information about the file: \n\n\n\n* Name: Enter a name for the file. The name is required to be unique within the Disruption module. The name will be referenced throughout the module. For example, the name will be listed in the Dashboard and available in a dropdown list when setting up Matching Configurations. \n* Description: This is an optional field where you can enter a brief description of the file. \n* Delimiter: This is an optional field where you can select the appropriate delimiter for the data within the .csv file. (If an Excel file is uploaded, this field does not apply). \n* Expiration: Select 60 days, 90 days, or Never Expire. \n* Sharing: If the Sharing checkbox is not selected, the file will be private, which means that only you will be able to view/use the file. If the Sharing checkbox is selected, all users of the Disruption module within your organization will be able to use the file. **Note**: Admin users will be able to view all Utilization Files by selecting the option to view shared files. This includes private and shared files  \n* Click the Save button.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhen a Utilization File is uploaded it goes through a validation process. During this process, you will see the **Processing Files** page displayed. You’ll notice that the **Status** of your uploaded file is “Validating.” After \"Validating\" it will go to the status \"Mapping\", and under **Actions** you will see \"Map and Approve\". \n\n## Column Aliases \n\n\n\nFor each Zelis Standard Column, you can create one or more Column Aliases that correspond to column headers commonly used in your Utilization Files. Column Aliases that match a header in a new Utilization File will be automatically mapped to a Zelis Standard Column, eliminating the need to manually map these columns for each new import. **Note**: If a column name on the Utilization File already matches a Zelis Standard Column Name, it will automatically be mapped. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n### Adding Column Aliases \n\n\n\nTo add column Aliases, click on **Column Aliases** on the **Utilization Files** page. Select a **Zelis Standard Column** from the dropdown list, then type one or more desired aliases and click on **Save Aliases**. \n\n\n\n![](/cms/cms-assets/media/addingcolumnaliases.png \"AddingColumnAliases\")"
