  "body": "Elasticlunr.js is a lightweight, full-text search engine written in JavaScript for use in browser search and offline search. It is based on Lunr.js but offers more flexibility, such as Query-Time boosting and field search. Elasticlunr.js is designed for environments where a full-scale search engine like Elasticsearch may be unnecessary or too complex. It allows for the indexing of JSON documents and provides a simple search interface to retrieve documents.\n\nKey features of Elasticlunr.js include:\n- Query-Time boosting: Allows for the adjustment of boosting weights at query time, making it more adaptable.\n- Rational scoring mechanism: Uses a scoring system similar to Elasticsearch and Lucene.\n- Field-search capability: Enables indexing and searching of specific fields within documents.\n- Boolean model: Supports boolean queries to refine search results.\n- Fast performance: Optimized for speed by removing certain components from Lunr.js.\n- Small index size: The index file is compact, making it suitable for offline search and environments with limited bandwidth.\n\nElasticlunr.js is particularly useful for static web pages that require search functionality, offline document search, or applications within restricted network environments. It's also a good choice for mobile devices where network traffic may be costly, and for Node.js systems that need to support a moderate number of documents without the overhead of a more complex system.\n\nFor developers looking to implement Elasticlunr.js, the library is open-source and documentation is available to guide through the setup and usage.",
