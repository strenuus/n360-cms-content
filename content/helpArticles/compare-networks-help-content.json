  "body": "## Overview\n\nCompare Networks is a powerful tool providing in-depth analysis of networks with overlap, volatility, network strength based on core providers, provider locations and offices. This module helps in comparing multiple networks but gives the best results in head-to-head scenarios.\n\nCompare Networks is available in the **Competitive Analysis** and **Sales Tools** modules.\n\n* Using Compare Networks, a list of providers that meet your selected criteria for the selected networks is used to: Size the market for a specific specialty.\n* Understand how your network ranks for a specific specialty or all specialties. \n* View overlap and exclusive provider counts.\n\n## Accessing Compare Networks\n\nTo access the Compare Networks module, on the left-hand sidebar navigation panel, click on either Competitive Analysis or Sales Tools and then select Compare Networks from the menu. The Compare Networks search criteria fields will be displayed.\n\n<image 1>\n\n## Search Criteria\n\nMost fields within the search criteria work as autosuggest lists. As you begin typing content into a field, the list will be populated with matching options. Your search criteria will determine which providers will be included in the network comparisons.\n\n### Within\n\nYou can optionally enter any combination of geographies in the **Within** field, including cities, counties, MSAs, CMS rating areas, state abbreviations, the name of a population file, or zip codes (3-digit or 5-digit). The system does not permit searching on partial zip codes or free form text. \n\nWhen you select multiple geographies, the search uses **OR** logic, therefore, if you enter Johnson County, KS and Topeka, KS MSA your results will contain providers that are in either geography. They do not have to be in both. \n\n**Recommendation:** Enter a geography to narrow your search and produce a more manageable comparison analysis. If you leave the **Within** field blank, your results will contain data from the project’s entire geography.\n\n<image 2>\n\n#### Population File\n\nThe option to create a Population File is available in the Within dropdown list. You can use a Population File by either uploading a file or creating a new file from the Within dropdown.  \n\nThe format of the uploaded file can be: .csv, .txt, .dat, or .xlsx.\n\nFor more details on using an existing Population file and creating a new Population file see: Population Files Help Content.\n\n<image 3>\n\nFor more information on using Bulk Search and Radius Search options, refer Bulk search and Radius search help contents.\n\n<image 4>\n\n<image 5>\n\n### Compare\n\nThe **compare** field is a single select dropdown. It is used to select the base network with which you want to compare other networks.\n\nThe list of base networks will be filtered by your selected geography.\n\n<image 6> \n\n### To\n\nThe **to** field is a multiselect dropdown. It is used to select one or more networks to which you want to compare to the base network selected in the **compare** field.    \n\nYour selections will be bolded within the dropdown list and appear in the **to** field. To remove a selection, click the “x” in the upper right corner of the item or use your backspace key. \n\n<image 7>\n\n### Using\n\nIn the **using** field, you can select Provider, Provider Location or Office counts to be compared. \n\n**Providers:** Counts each provider only once, regardless of the number of locations.\n\n**Provider Locations:** Counts each provider at each location where they practice.\n\n**Office:** Counts each location only once, regardless of the number of providers at each location. \n\n<image 8>\n\nChecking **Confirmed practicing only** shows providers who have been confirmed practicing.\n\nFor more details on Confirmed practicing only, click here.\n\nThe Project and Specialty Mapping that have been selected will determine the core provider types that will be returned in the analysis. A description of what will be returned is provided to the left of the **Compare** button. The screenshots below show two versions of the description.\n\n<image 9>\n\n<image 10>\n\nClick on **Compare** button. Compare Results page is displayed. \n\n## Compare Results Page\n\nThe **Compare Results** page displays the comparison parameters for the networks that were selected in the search criteria page.\nAn overview of each comparison is displayed in the following quadrants:\n\n* Overlap \n* Average Monthly Volatility \n* Top Specialty groups \n* Network Strength\n\nEach of these quadrants provides access to more details.\n\n<image 11>\n\nNote: Currently, selecting **Confirmed Practicing** displays only two quadrants (Overlap and Network Strengths).\n\n<image 12>\n\n### Changing Your Selected Criteria\n\nTo change your criteria once you are on the **Compare Results** page, click the **Edit criteria** link to return to the criteria selection page.   \n\n<image 13>\n\n### Overlap Quadrant\n\nWhen a single network is selected for comparison, a Venn diagram shows the  overlap between the base network and the comparison network (the common area in the middle of both the networks). \n\nThe outer areas of the Venn diagram show the data that is exclusive to each network. The information is also presented in a table format. \n\nThis information can be on the number of providers or the number of locations depending on what was selected in the **using** field in the search criteria.\n\n<image 14>\n\nYou can hover over the exclusive or overlapping areas to see their respective count. When you click on those areas the detailed provider list will be displayed. Similarly, the same provider list is also obtained when you click on the values displayed in blue under **Total** and **Exclusive** headings. \n\n<image 15>\n\nClicking on the **View Details** link opens the **Overlap Details** page where you can view a comparison of provider types by the base and comparison networks.\n\n<image 16>\n\n<image 17>\n\nFor example, in the above image, the left graph compares the number of providers that have a provider type of General Dentist and have a specialty of Dentistry General for base network and comparison network. The right graph compares the number of providers in those networks that have a provider type of Specialist. Examples of specialties are Orthodontics, Periodontics, etc.\n\nYou can navigate back to the Comparison Results page by clicking on the **Back to Summary** link. \n\nIf multiple networks were selected in the compare **to** field in the search criteria, the result in the Overlap quadrant is displayed as sets of bar graphs displaying a comparison of the base network with each selected network.\n\n<image 18>\n\nYou can click on each part of the bar graph to see the detailed provider list for that network. \n\nClicking on the **View details** link in the upper right corner, opens the **Overlap Details** page, which contains two view options. They are:\n\n* Overlap with Each Network\n* Overlap with All Networks\n\n#### Overlap with Each Network\n\nThis is a comparison of the exclusive and overlap of the base network with each of the comparison networks. Depending on the   selected Project and Specialty Mapping, you will see options to view by All Provider Types or by Specialty.\n\n<image 19>\n\nFor example, in the above image, the **All Provider Types** compares the number of providers for All Provider Types for each combination of base network and comparison network. It also shows the options to see the same information for **General Dentist** and **Specialist** by clicking on the grey bar above the graph.\n\nYou can navigate back to the Comparison Results page by clicking on the **Back to Summary** link.\n\n#### Overlap with All Networks\n\nSimilar to **Overlap with All Networks** for single network comparison, the left graph compares the number of providers that have a provider type of General Dentist and have a specialty of Dentistry General for base network and Comparison networks. The right graph compares the number of providers in those networks that have a provider type of Specialist.\n\nExamples of specialties are Orthodontics, Periodontics, etc.\n\n<image 20>\n\n### Average Monthly Volatility Quadrant\n\nAverage monthly volatility helps in understanding the number of providers added to and dropped from the network from the last time the project data had been refreshed.\n\n<image 21>\n\nYou can hover on each bar to view the number of providers that were added to or dropped from the base network or the comparison network(s). \n\n<image 22>\n\nYou can click on the **Add%** or **Drop%** bars to see the detailed provider list of added or dropped providers for that network. The screenshot below shows a list of 32 Providers who were added to the Aetna Dental Access P network.\n\n**Note:** Volatility bars are not clickable as this quantity is not associated with any specific group of providers.  \n\n<image 23>\n\nWhen you click on **View by geography** in **Average Monthly Volatility** quadrant in the **Compare Results** page, the **Compare Networks** page with a **Volatility Map** will be displayed. Information on the number of changed provider locations is displayed on hovering over the marked regions on the map. \n\n<image 24>\n\nIf multiple networks are selected in the compare **to** field in the search criteria, the result in the Average Monthly Volatility quadrant is displayed in a similar manner as a single comparison network.\n\n<image 25>\n\nYou can hover the base network’s bars to view the number of providers that were added to or dropped from the network. You can click on the base network’s bars to see the detailed provider list of added or dropped providers for that network.\n\n<image 26>\n\nThe Comparison Average bars will contain two or more networks and hence cannot display hover information and are not clickable.   \n\nWhen you click on the **View by networks** link (located in the upper right corner in the **Average Monthly Volatility** quadrant), the **Compare Networks** page with **Volatility Details** opens.\n\nThe adds and drops for the base network and each comparison network is displayed individually in this page. You can hover over each portion of the bars to view the number of providers.\n\n<image 27>\n\n### Top Specialty Groups Quadrant\n\nThe Top Specialty Groups quadrant helps in comparing the top specialties available within the base network and the selected comparison network(s).\n\n<image 28>\n\nYou can hover over each bar to view the number of providers out of the total number of providers that have that specialty in the selected   network. Click on these bars to see the detailed provider list.\n\n**Note: A provider that has multiple specialties can be included in more than one of specialty categories.**\n\n<image 29>\n\nClicking on the **View details** link (located in the upper right corner) opens the **Compare Networks** page with **Specialty Group Detail**s."
