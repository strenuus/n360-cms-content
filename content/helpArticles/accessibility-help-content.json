Then select **Accessibility**. This brings you to the **Manage Accessibility Analyses** page.\n\n## Manage Accessibility Analyses Page\n\nOn the Manage Accessibility Analyses page, you can view a grid which shows all the analyses and their status within your selected project.\n\n* By clicking the Action Filter icon in the top right corner of the grid, you   can choose which columns display within the grid: \n\n  * Name\n  * Description\n  * Status\n  * Population File\n  * Specialty Mapping\n  * Network – This is your Base Network\n  * Specification\n  * Last Updated \n  * Created By\n\n    <image 1>\n* To change the sort order of a column, click on the column header.\n* Filter options are below the column headers:\n\n  * Type into a blank field to search for your desired result, or\n  * Select from the dropdown list\n\n#### Status Definitions\n\n* **Queued** – displays when many analyses are run at the same time and the analysis is pending.\n* **In Progress** – displays while the analysis is in progress.\n* **Suspended** – displays after the project has been re-imported/promoted.  This indicates that the analysis needs to be run again to see the results.\n* **Incomplete** – displays for multiple reasons:\n\n  * Some of the analysis criteria has been deleted (e.g. a population file, specialty mapping, specification, or network) \n  * A published Model Network changes to Draft status.\n\n**Note:** Hovering over this status will display a tool tip pop-up identifying the specific issue.\n\n* **Ready** – displays when the analysis is ready to be viewed.  \n\n   **Note:** Editing an analysis in Ready status might require the analysis to be prepared or performed \tagain.  \n* **Failed** – displays for multiple reasons. Hovering over this status will display a tool tip pop-up identifying why the analysis failed.\n\nAfter a Project is refreshed, the Status will change to **Suspended** or **Incomplete** based on availability of the analysis components.  \n\nIf you view an analysis that uses a different specialty mapping than your currently selected Specialty Mapping, the specialty mapping will update to match the mapping that is used within the analysis. \n\n**Note:** Only Administrator users will be able to edit or delete other users’ Accessibility analyses.  \n\n## Creating a New Accessibility Analysis\n\n To execute a new Accessibility analysis, you will need the following pieces of information: \n\n* Population File\n* Network Selection\n* Specification\n\n<image 2>\n\n* **Name** – Give your analysis a name. This is a required field.\n* **Description** – Add a description of your analysis. This is optional.\n* **Population File** – This is a required field. \n\n  For more information on using and creating a Population file, click here <insert link>\n* **Base Network** - Select a network that will be used as a benchmark. This is a required field.\n* **Comparison Network** – This is an optional field. \n  * Select one or more comparison networks, or\n  * Leave the field blank – By not making a selection, an analysis will be performed on the **Base Network** only. \n* **Report Grouping** - Report Grouping determines how your results will be grouped on the **Geographic Summary** tab. For example, if you select **County** then you will see a section for each County associated with your population file. This is a required field.\n\n   **Notes:** \n\n  * Only the Base Network is considered in the **Access Map** and **Gap Map** results. \n\n    * Accessibility will be calculated for the Comparison Networks as well, but they will not be evaluated in these maps.\n\n  * If more than six networks are selected in total, the Hospital Report will not be available in the PDF export, though it will still be viewable in the application.\n\n* **Specification** – This is a required field.\n\nFor more information on using and creating a Specification, click here <insert link>\n\nAdvanced Options – Clicking on the Advanced Options link will display additional filter options. \n\n•\tConfidence - Confidence-level filters can be applied to Address and/or Specialty data. You can select one the following options for each category: \n\no\tAny single confidence level\n\no\tHigh & Medium confidence\n\no\tMedium & Low confidence"
