  "body": "Accessibility is a powerful tool that allows you to determine whether networks provide sufficient access to members in a geographic area using standards detailed within a specification.\n\nAccessibility is a premium feature of Network360 and may not be available to all users.\n\n## Navigation\n\nTo navigate to this module, click on one of the following modules on the left side bar navigation menu: **Competitive Analysis, Sales Tools, Compliance,** or **Broker Tools**.  Then select **Accessibility**. This brings you to the **Manage Accessibility Analyses** page.\n\n## Manage Accessibility Analyses Page\n\nOn the Manage Accessibility Analyses page, you can view a grid which shows all the analyses and their status within your selected project.\n\n* By clicking the Action Filter icon in the top right corner of the grid, you   can choose which columns display within the grid: \n\n  * Name\n  * Description\n  * Status\n  * Population File\n  * Specialty Mapping\n  * Network – This is your Base Network\n  * Specification\n  * Last Updated \n  * Created By\n\n    <image 1>\n* To change the sort order of a column, click on the column header.\n* Filter options are below the column headers:\n\n  * Type into a blank field to search for your desired result, or\n  * Select from the dropdown list\n\n#### Status Definitions\n\n* **Queued** – displays when many analyses are run at the same time and the analysis is pending.\n* **In Progress** – displays while the analysis is in progress.\n* **Suspended** – displays after the project has been re-imported/promoted.  This indicates that the analysis needs to be run again to see the results.\n* **Incomplete** – displays for multiple reasons:\n\n  * Some of the analysis criteria has been deleted (e.g. a population file, specialty mapping, specification, or network) \n  * A published Model Network changes to Draft status.\n\n**Note:** Hovering over this status will display a tool tip pop-up identifying the specific issue.\n\n* **Ready** – displays when the analysis is ready to be viewed.  \n\n   **Note:** Editing an analysis in Ready status might require the analysis to be prepared or performed \tagain.  \n* **Failed** – displays for multiple reasons. Hovering over this status will display a tool tip pop-up identifying why the analysis failed.\n\nAfter a Project is refreshed, the Status will change to **Suspended** or **Incomplete** based on availability of the analysis components.  \n\nIf you view an analysis that uses a different specialty mapping than your currently selected Specialty Mapping, the specialty mapping will update to match the mapping that is used within the analysis. \n\n**Note:** Only Administrator users will be able to edit or delete other users’ Accessibility analyses.  \n\n## Creating a New Accessibility Analysis\n\n To execute a new Accessibility analysis, you will need the following pieces of information: \n\n* Population File\n* Network Selection\n* Specification\n\n<image 2>\n\n* **Name** – Give your analysis a name. This is a required field.\n* **Description** – Add a description of your analysis. This is optional.\n* **Population File** – This is a required field. \n\n  For more information on using and creating a Population file, click here <insert link>\n* **Base Network** - Select a network that will be used as a benchmark. This is a required field.\n* **Comparison Network** – This is an optional field. \n\n  * Select one or more comparison networks, or\n  * Leave the field blank – By not making a selection, an analysis will be performed on the **Base Network** only. \n* **Report Grouping** - Report Grouping determines how your results will be grouped on the **Geographic Summary** tab. For example, if you select **County** then you will see a section for each County associated with your population file. This is a required field.\n\n   **Notes:** \n\n  * Only the Base Network is considered in the **Access Map** and **Gap Map** results. \n\n    * Accessibility will be calculated for the Comparison Networks as well, but they will not be evaluated in these maps.\n  * If more than six networks are selected in total, the Hospital Report will not be available in the PDF export, though it will still be viewable in the application.\n* **Specification** – This is a required field.\n\n   For more information on using and creating a Specification, click here <insert link>\n\n**Advanced Options** – Clicking on the Advanced Options link will display additional filter options. \n\n* **Confidence** - Confidence-level filters can be applied to **Address** and/or **Specialty** data. You can select one the following options for each category: \n\n  * Any single confidence level\n  * High & Medium confidence\n  * Medium & Low confidence\n\n       <image 3>\n\n   Your analysis results will show members’ access to providers and provider locations that meet your confidence level criteria.\n* **Attributes** – This is a custom filter, based on client subscriptions. For more information on using the **Attributes** filter, click here <insert link>\n\nTo view the **Analysis Results**, click on the **Prepare Analysis** button.\n\n## Analysis Results\n\nAt the top of the Analysis Results page, you can:\n\n* View the summary of your selected criteria by clicking on the **Show/Hide Analysis Criteria** toggle.\n* Edit the criteria of your analysis by clicking on the pencil icon to the right of your analysis name.\n* Create a new analysis by clicking on the **Perform another analysis** link.\n\n  <image 4>\n\n  Below the criteria summary are 9 tabs: **Access Comparison** (default tab), **Geographic Summary**, **Specialty Summary**, **Access Map**, **Gap Map**, **Gap Details**, **Top Markets**, **Top Hospitals** and **Recruiting**, each of which are described in detail below.\n\n  <image 5>\n\nWhen you first view the analysis results on the **Access Comparison** tab:\n\n* The **Specialty** filter will be set to **All (Compound Access)** which utilizes the compound methodology to calculate access based on the percentage of beneficiaries/members that have access to all specialties’ standards identified in your specification.\n\n  * By selecting one specialty in the filter, the access will be calculated for only your selected specialty.\n\n    <image 6>\n* The **Geography** filter will be auto-filled with the population file that is part of your analysis criteria. \n\n  * You can type ahead or select from the dropdown list to change the filter to a geography associated with your population file, e.g. county, MSA, zip code(s), or state(s).\n\nRemember to click the **Apply Filter** button after you change your filter settings. The graphs will then update using your filter selection.\n\n### Access Comparison Tab\n\nOn the Access Comparison tab, the results show the access information for the selected specialty and geography for each network and the Total Market. You will see the following for each network within your analysis: \n\n* Percentage of members with access\n* Median distance between members and the closest provider, in miles\n\n  * The median distance for members without access to the closest provider is included in the calculation of the median distance.\n* The network’s market penetration for your selected **Specialty** and **Geography**.\n\n<image 7>\n\n* **Percentage of Members with Access**\n\n  * **Total Market** is listed first.\n  * Networks are ranked by the highest percentage of members with access. \n\n    * If the **Specialty** filter is set to All (Compound Access), the networks will be ranked by the percentage of members with access to all specialties within the selected geography, i.e. using the compound methodology of determining access. \n    * If the **Specialty** filter is set to a specific specialty, the networks will be ranked by the percentage of members with access to that specialty within the selected geography, i.e. using the standard methodology of determining access. \n  * You can scroll down to view the table which conveys the numerical information represented in the graph.\n* **Median Distance to Closest Provider in Miles** \n\n  * This box and whisker plot conveys the range and median distance that members within the selected geography need to travel to their closest provider locations.\n\n    **Note:** Network360 uses representative placement for member locations which ensures that PHI is not disclosed in these analyses.\n  * The ends of the line in the box and whisker plot show the maximum distance and minimum distance.\n  * The boxed area shows the 2nd and 3rd quartiles of distances.\n  * The line in the middle represents the median travel distance. \n  * When you mouse over the graphs, a tooltip will appear giving detailed information. \n  * You can scroll down to view the table which conveys the numerical information represented in the graph. \n* **Percentage of Providers in Network**\n\n  * This graph depicts the market penetration of providers within your selected **Specialty** and **Geography**. \n  * To see a list of the In-Network providers within your selected **Specialty** and **Geography**, click on the bar in the graph. This will take you to the **Summary Results** page where you can click on the number of **Unique Providers** to view **Detail Results**.\n\n    <image 8>\n\n    <image 9>\n  * You can also scroll down to view the table which conveys the numerical information in the graph.  \n\n    * Within the table, you can click on the **Count** of **Providers** in network and view the list of providers. \n    * When members matching your filter criteria do not have access as defined by the standards within your specification, you will see a message explaining this.\n\nThere can be geographic areas in which there is a high percentage of members who have access, but there are no providers within the area selected in the geography filters.  For example, there are members within Waldo, FL, but there are no Primary Care provider locations in my selected networks within Waldo, FL; these members have access to provider locations outside of Waldo, FL that are within the distance range in the specification.  \n\n<image 10>\n\n### Geographic Summary Tab\n\nThis tab displays the **Percentage of Members with Access**, the **Median Distance to Closest Provider in Miles**, and the **Percentage of Providers in Network** for up to 5 networks.\n\n* Your results will be grouped by type of geographic region.  For example, if your Report Grouping (selected during analysis creation) is County, then you’ll see a section for each County associated with your population file. \n\n   <image 11>\n* There are three filters on this tab: **Specialty**, **Geography**, and **Comparison Networks**.  Once you make your selections, click the **Apply Filters** button to see your results.  Your filter selections will auto-fill on other tabs when appropriate. \n\n  <image 12>\n\n#### Specialty Filter\n\n* The **Specialty** filter dropdown includes the specialties for standards within your specification. \n\n   You can also select **All (Compound Access)** where access is defined as having access to all specialties for standards within your specification.  \n* You can only select one option on the **Specialty** filter.   \n\n#### Geography Filter\n\n* The Geography filter is auto-filled with the population file that you used in your analysis.  \n* If you selected a Geography filter on a different tab, that selection will appear on this tab.  \n* You can select other geographies associated with your population file.\n* Your **Geography** filter selection will impact the results.  \n\n  * For example, if your **Geography** filter consists of a subset of your **Report Grouping**, then you will see results for only the filter area within the results section.  In other words, if your **Report Grouping** is County and your filter is set to one zip code within XYZ County, your results will show the data for the zip code and section will be titled “XYZ County.” \n\n#### Comparison Networks Filter\n\n* The Comparison Networks filter dropdown includes all the networks in your analysis and Total Market so you can compare your Base network’s access to a maximum of 4 other networks.  \n\n  * If you select Total Market, that will be counted as one of the 4 networks.  \n* The default for the Comparison Networks filter is the Top 4 Networks.  \n\n  * With this selection, each result section will display your Base network plus the best 4 comparison networks.   \n* After making your filter selections, click **Apply Filters**.  If you change your filter selections, the results will display after you click **Apply Filters** again. \n* Within the results, your Base network’s name will be bolded and be preceded by an asterisk. \n* You can choose a **Display Mode** to see the results presented in a chart or in a table of data. \n\n<image 13>\n\n* The results will show the following:\n\n  * **Chart mode:** a bar graph of the percentage of members with access for each network, a box and whiskers plot showing the 2nd and 3rd quartiles and median distance for the closest providers to members with access, and a bar graph of the percentage of providers in the network.\n  * **Table mode:** this data is displayed in a numerical format. \n* Within each result section, the networks display in ranked order by the percentage of members with access for that specialty.  If Total Market is selected, this will be the top-most network. \n\n### Specialty Summary Tab\n\nThe Specialty Summary tab displays the **Percentage of Members with Access**, the **Median Distance to Closest Provider in Miles**, and the **Percentage of Providers in Network** for up to 5 networks.\n\n* There are three types of filters on this tab: **Specialty**, **Geography**, and **Comparison Networks**.\n* Once you make your selections, click the **Apply Filters** button to see your results. Your results will be grouped by your selected **Specialties**.\n\n#### Specialty Filter\n\n* The **Specialty** filter default is **All Specialties.** With this selection, your results will display every specialty associated with standards in your specification.\n* Within this filter, you can choose your desired specialties.\n\n#### Geography Filter\n\n* The **Geography** filter default is the population file used in your analysis.\n* Within this filter, you can choose your desired geographies.\n* Your results will display the information for a specialty across all your selected geographies.  \n\n#### Comparison Networks Filter\n\nThe **Comparison Networks** filter includes all the networks in your analysis and Total Market so you can compare your Base network’s access to a maximum of 4 other networks.  If you select Total Market, that will be counted as one of the 4 networks.  \n\n* The **Comparison Networks** filter default is the **Top 4 Networks**.  With this selection, each result section will display your Base network plus the best 4 comparison networks.\n\nOnce you make your filter selections, click the **Apply Filter** button.  \n\n* Within the results, your Base network’s name will be bolded and be preceded by an asterisk. \n* You can choose the display mode to see the results presented in a **Chart** or in a **Table** of data. \n* Based on your selection, the results will show the following:  \n\n  * **Chart** mode:\n\n       * A bar graph of the percentage of members with access for each network\n\n       * A box and whiskers plot showing the 2nd and 3rd quartiles and median distance for the closest providers to members \n       * A bar graph of the percentage of providers in the network\n\n    <image 14>\n  * **Table** mode:\n\n    * Data is displayed in a numerical format\n\n      <image 15>\n* Within each result section, the networks display in ranked order by the percentage of Members with Access for that specialty.  If Total Market is selected, this will be the top-most network. \n\n### Access Map Tab\n\nThis map shows the access information for your **Base Network** for a single specialty within your geography filter selection.\n* Your filter selections on the **Access Comparison** tab are automatically applied to the map. However, if you selected **All (Compound Access)** specialties on the Access Comparison tab, you would need to select a single specialty or provider type to view the map.\n\n    * To change your **Specialty** selection, choose a selection from the **Specialty** dropdown list or enter the specialty.  (The contents of the specialties list are determined by the standards in your specification.) \n   * Click the **Apply Filter** button to see the map updated with your selection. \n   * Your filter selections on this tab will automatically update filter selections on the **Access Comparison** tab and the displayed results. \n   * When you change the filter criteria on the **Access Comparison** or **Access Map** tabs, the results will display only once you have clicked on the **Apply Filter** button. \n   * To see your previous results, update the filter criteria and click the **Apply Filter** button.\n* This interactive map allows you to choose which elements will display on the map: \n  * **Providers**\n  * **Provider radiuses** (the service areas of providers) based on your **Area Type** selections\n  * **Members with access**\n  * **Members without access**\n\n<image 16>\n  * **Area Types:** The available area types are determined by your **Area Types** selection in your Specification (CBSA or USR). \n  * **Provider Radiuses:** The radius of a provider’s service area is depicted by purple shaded circles.\n  \n    * If you select **all Area Types**, you will see circles of various shades of purple depicting the access area that a provider serves based on the member’s county’s area type. \n    * You can drag the slide bar up or down to display only one of the area types.  \n       * Analyses that use “estimated driving distance” will display circles with blurred edges to communicate the estimation (shown below).\n       * Analyses that use “straight line distance” will display circles with well-defined edges. \n    * Providers: White dots represent provider locations.\n    * Members: \n       * Green dots represent Members with Access\n       * Red dots represent Members without Access \n    \n      **Note:** Network360 uses representative placement for member locations which ensures that PHI is not disclosed.\n\n<image 17>\n\n"
