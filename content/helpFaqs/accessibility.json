      "answer": "An accessibility specification is a collection of accessibility standards based on requiring a minimum number of providers within a certain distance. Two distance types are offered:\n\n- Straight-Line Distance (As The Crow Flies)\n- Estimated Driving Distance/Drive Time\n\nRegulatory minimum count and mileage standards for a given provider type or specialty usually vary depending on the population density of the area where members are located. Two most commonly used population density classifications are offered: CBSA (Large Metro, Metro, Micro, Rural, CEAC) and USR (Urban-Suburban-Rural).\n\n",

      "question": "I checked the distance on a map application and the distance was not the same.",
      "answer": "Estimated Driving Distance is the approximate undirected driving distance from the zip+4 representative placement to the specific provider. Due to the large number of distance calculations in an accessibility analysis that combines all plans and providers in a project, approximation methods are preferred over calculating actual distances which are computationally very slow. Estimated Driving Distance formula is a mix of highly accurate best-fit equations based on multiple regression analysis that are adjusted for varied geographies and urban categorizations.\n\n",

The radius of each circle coincides with the mileage requirement as defined in the Accessibility Specification. Thus, only providers located within the circle could potentially improve access for that employee location. Providers outside of the overlapping circles are shown for reference only. The provider marker symbols are:\n\n\n- Green markers indicate high confidence provider locations, yellow indicates medium confidence, and red indicates low confidence.\n- Markers with check-marks in them are in-network providers. In-network refers to the selected Base Network.\n- Markers without check-marks are out-of-network providers. When located within the red overlapping circles, they constitute the providers with whom the access percentage could be increased if they were part of the network. These providers can be considered as your recruiting target.\n- Clusters represent locations with many providers.
