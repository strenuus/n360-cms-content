Administrative users can create, edit or delete an Enterprise tag from the system.\n- **Blue**: Global tags are system-wide tags available to every client (ie, Recruiting: Target, Inactive: Retired). Global tags can be seen and used by all users in the project. Global tags cannot be edited or deleted from the system by any user.\n- **Purple**: System Generated Automatic tags are automatically applied when data is imported into the system (ie, Medicare PAR). System Generated tags can be seen by all users in the project but cannot be applied to or removed from a provider or provider location.
