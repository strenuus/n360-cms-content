      "question": "How do I share the results?",
      "answer": "After you’ve saved a ranking with a name other than New Ranking, the Save button will be replaced by the Share button. There are four options. Share Results allows you to email a link to the results page. Recipients need not be Network360 users. They can view but not modify the results, and cannot access any other parts of Network360 unless they log in. Send Survey creates a link that you can email to other people, such as employees, who can select providers that are important to them. Their selections are then aggregated and saved in the Network Ranking. Export as PDF creates a PDF version of the report that can be saved or shared. Export Selected Providers creates a list of selected providers that can be exported and saved or shared.\n\n"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the survey look like?",
      "answer": "By clicking Send Survey under the Share options, and then clicking Share via Email, you can see the text of the survey email and the link that is provided. Optionally, you can copy just the link into an email that you create to send to participants. Although participants’ selections will be visible in the ranking results, no personally identifiable information is collected or saved.\n\n"
