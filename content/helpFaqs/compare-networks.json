      "answer": "1. Select the base network for the comparison (_Compare_).\n2. Select one or more comparison networks (_to_). If you select multiple comparison networks, the results for the comparison networks will be aggregated in the report. In most cases, you'll be able to toggle the results between the combined networks and a single network.\n3. Specify the geographic limitations of your network comparison (_within_). You can enter cities, counties, MSAs, state abbreviations, zip codes, population files or custom regions if available. If left blank, the entire geography for the project will be used.\n\n",

Office will count unique locations. Please note all drill-down features may not be available for Provider Location or Office counts.\n\nIf your project contains Confirmed Practicing data, you can also choose to have the results include only providers, providers locations, or offices that have been confirmed. Currently, when using Confirmed Practicing providers, provider locations, or offices, the results only include **Overlap** and **Network Strength** sections.\n\n",

      "answer": "**Compare Networks** contains counts for “Individuals”. An Individual refers to a unique provider.\n\nIn Medical projects, the Provider Types are Primary Care, Specialist, Hospital, Individual. A provider can practice both as Primary Care (Family Practice) and Specialist (Allergy and Immunology). They would be counted once as Primary Care and once as Specialist but once as Individual.\n\nIn Dental projects, the Provider Types are General Dentist, Specialist and Individual. A provider can practice both as General Dentist (General Dentist) and Specialist (Pediatric Dentist). They would be counted once as General Dentist and once as Specialist, but once as Individual.\n\n",

      "answer": "**Volatility** is a measure of how much the network is changing over time. When available, the system compares the provider counts in the selected networks to the counts from the previous “generation” (usually about three months prior), and then computes a monthly average percentage based on network size. The percentages can be compared regardless of the interval between network data refreshes, which may differ from one network to another. If multiple comparison networks are selected, the percentages for the comparison networks are averaged.\n\nIf a single comparison network is used,\n\n- Click on the bars to generate a list of added or dropped providers. Some dropped providers may no longer present in the current project data and therefore will not be on the Provider List.\n- Click _View by geography_ to see providers added or dropped since the previous generation plotted on a map. Clusters can be expanded by clicking on them. Mouse over individual provider markers for additional information or click on them to visit the provider profile.\n\nIf multiple comparison networks are used,\n\n- Click on the bars to generate a list where of added or dropped providers for the base network only. The bars for multiple comparison networks cannot be clicked.\n- Click _View by Network_ to view **Network Volatility**, a bar chart of add and drops by network.\n- Click single network bars to view a list of providers.
