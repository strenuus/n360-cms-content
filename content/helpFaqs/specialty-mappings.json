      "question": "What is a Specialty Mapping?",
      "answer": "A Specialty Mapping is used to determine how each specialty is reported in the system. It is a crosswalk between specialties, specialty groups, and provider types. Each specialty can belong to only one specialty group and only one provider type. For example, Pediatric Cardiology may belong to the Cardiology specialty group or to the Pediatrics specialty group. Additionally, the Pediatrics specialty group may belong in the Primary Care provider type or in the Specialist provider type.\n\n",

    {
      "question": "What impact does a Specialty Mapping have on my analysis?",
      "answer": "The Specialty Mapping configured for your project impacts the results of every analysis. Comparison results are dependent on the Specialty Mapping in use at the time the analysis is performed. The Specialty Mapping in use when a network comparison is created is not saved with the comparison activity. If the Specialty Mapping is changed and you run the comparison again, the new Specialty Mapping will be used and results are likely to be different.\n\n",

The **Available Specialty Mappings** contains all specialty mappings available to the user.
