      "question": "What are the criteria options for Competitive Dashboard?",
      "answer": "Click on the Competitive Dashboard tile on the left-hand side of the Network360™ system.\n\n- The criteria fields on the Competitive Dashboard form are **Geography**, **Networks**, **Counts**, **Sort by**, **Group by** geographic grouping, **Exclude** networks with less than a specified Market Penetration. For projects with Confirmed Practicing data, the **Show** selections will determine whether to display Directory, Confirmed, or Side-by-side.\n- In the **Geography** field, enter the geography you would like to use for the analysis. The form offers a variety of geographic search options: Standard, Bulk Zip Code, Radius, Population File.\n  - **Standard**: Enter any combination of geographies, including cities, counties, MSAs, CMS rating areas, state abbreviations, zip codes, or population files.\n  - **Bulk Zip Code**: Paste up to 200 zip codes.\n  - **True Radius**: When a single zip code is defined, true radius finds providers within the radius of the centroid of the defined zip code, regardless of the zip codes they are in. Zip centroid refers to the center of a zip code or center of the zip code mass.\n  - **Zip Radius**: When more than one zip code is defined, zip radius finds providers in zip codes whose centroids are within the radius of the centroid of the defined zip codes. Zip centroid refers to the center of a zip code or center of the zip code mass.\n  - **Population File**: A population file is comprised of zip codes and individual counts. Population files can be saved for future use and shared with other users.\n  - **Blank**: If the Geography field is left blank, the entire geography of the project will be used.\n- In the **Networks** field, select specific networks or use the All options\n  - All my networks\n  - All competitor networks\n  - All project networks\n- In the **Counts** field, select the count type. Depending on the count type selected, \"drill-down\" functionality may not be available.\n  - Count type options include: Provider, Provider Location, Office, or All count types.\n- In the **Sort** by field, choose the order in which you want your results. Sort results by Alphanumeric, My networks first, or Network size.\n- Choose the **Group by** option for reports. The selection impacts how counts are calculated and grouped in exports. Groupings include County, MSA, Market Geographic Rating Area, State, Zip3 and Zip5.\n- You can choose to **Exclude** the networks with less than 0%-25% market penetration to remove outlying networks from the analysis.\n- For projects with Confirmed Practicing data, the **Show** selections will determine whether to display Directory, Confirmed, or Side-by-side.\n  - Directory: Analysis displays all records within project.\n  - Confirmed: Analysis displays only confirmed practicing records within the project.\n  - Side-by-side: Analysis displays both Directory and Confirmed.\n- Once you have chosen the criteria, click **Go** to run the analysis.\n\n"
