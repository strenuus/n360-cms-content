      "question": "What is a CMS Market Geographic Rating Area?",
      "answer": "CMS has a concept of exchange rating areas or CMS Market Geographic Rating Area - to make sure they allow monitoring and equal actuarial treatment in the markets. These are multi-geography regions that exist in each state for the purpose of marketing (and pricing) exchange networks. Depending on the state, they are either County based, MSA based or a mix. We have translated all of these rating areas to Zip codes that are within those geographies.\n\n"
