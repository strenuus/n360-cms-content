However, an analysis still takes longer to run the first time than the second time an analysis with the same networks and specification runs.\n* Now on the PDF export of the Results > Access Comparison tab, when you set select “All (Compound Access)” the criteria will show “All (Compound Access).”\n* Now on the Results > Specialty Summary tab, when you select multiple specialties or all specialties, the criteria will list each specialty separated by the “OR” conjunction, e.g. “Cardiology OR Dermatology OR Endocrinology.”"
