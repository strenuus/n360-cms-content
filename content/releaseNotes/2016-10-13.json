If a report includes a zip code that has been added, or if the Zip classification has changed, new analysis may not exactly match an analysis that was previously run on that geography.</li>\n    <li><b>The new classifications will take effect once a project is reloaded, or during the next regular processing.</b></li>\t\n\t</ul>\n</ul>\n"
